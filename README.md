The bonus project for Comp Bio! Happy HeyDay!

Hey Day is one of my favorite Auburn Traditions! This tradition started when Auburn was a younger school, and students turned soldiers who faught in WWII came home. It was not a homecoming they imagined as the students who stayed in Auburn did not integrate them back as the soldiers had wished. So, HeyDay was created to ensure Auburn stays the most friendly, and the happiest university in North America.

This tradition is so much fun, and I have been collecting my nametags since freshman year!
